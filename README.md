# Instructions for Reproducing Simulations and Code

1. Install [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) (I used Julia 1.11.3) and the [Pluto package](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl)
2. Download the supporting libraries
	- clone the [growth simulation (AbxGrowthSims)](https://github.com/codercahol/AbxGrowthSims/tree/main) and [data analysis (RNA_over\_Protein\_analysis)](https://github.com/codercahol/RNA_over_Protein_analysis)* repositories to your computer
3. Follow the instructions in the pluto notebooks and have fun!


\* - the RNA\_over\_Protein_analysis code is only used for a single figure in the supplementary
